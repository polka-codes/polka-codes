  Use #methodName / #fieldName for private methods and fields
  Use `bun` as the package manager
  When adding new dependencies, cd to the package directory and run `bun add <dependency>`
  Use `bun:test` to write tests. DO NOT use jest or mocha or vi
  DO NOT use mock in tests. Use spyOn imported bun 'bun:test' if needed
  When writing unit tests, use `.toMatchSnapshot()` if suitable.
  In tests, ensure no redundant assertions. i.e. if `.toMatchSnapshot()` is used, then there is no need to have other assertions.
  NEVER mock modules

  DO NOT use comment as section separators
