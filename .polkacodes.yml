rules: |
  Use `bun` as the package manager
  When adding new dependencies, cd to the package directory and run `bun add <dependency>`
  Use `bun:test` to write tests. DO NOT use jest or mocha or vi
  DO NOT use mock in tests. Use spyOn imported bun 'bun:test' if needed
  When writing unit tests, use `.toMatchSnapshot()` if suitable
  When creating a new file, try to check if there are other files with similar content, and if so, read those files and use them as a reference
