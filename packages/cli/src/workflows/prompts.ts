export function getWorkflowContextPrompt(): string {
  return `# Code Workflow Context

You are participating in a 3-phase development workflow:

1. **Planning Phase** (Architect Agent)
   - Analyzes requirements and creates detailed implementation plan
   - User reviews and approves the plan before implementation begins

2. **Implementation Phase** (Coder Agent)
   - Implements the approved plan from phase 1
   - Makes code changes following the plan and project conventions
   - Can delegate subtasks or hand over to specialized agents

3. **Fixing Phase** (CodeFixer Agent)
   - Runs validation commands (tests, type checks, linting)
   - Fixes any errors that arise during validation
   - Ensures code quality and correctness

`
}

export function getImplementPrompt(plan: string): string {
  return `${getWorkflowContextPrompt()}**YOU ARE IN PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION**

Your task is to implement the plan created and approved in Phase 1.

## Your Plan

<plan>
${plan}
</plan>

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Plan Analysis

Before starting implementation:
- Review the plan carefully and understand all requirements
- Identify dependencies between different parts of the plan
- Determine if this is a single cohesive task or multiple independent tasks
- Consider the scope and complexity of the work

### 2. Gather Context

Before making changes:
- **Search for similar existing files** to understand patterns and conventions
- **Read relevant files** to see how similar features are implemented
- Look for existing tests, utilities, or helpers you can leverage
- Understand the project structure and naming conventions
- Verify you have all necessary context to proceed

### 3. Choose Your Approach

**Option A: Single Implementation (use handOver tool)**
- When the plan is a single cohesive task
- When all steps are tightly coupled and interdependent
- When you need to maintain context across all changes
- Implement everything yourself and hand over when complete

**Option B: Delegate Subtasks (use delegate tool)**
- When the plan has multiple independent steps or features
- When tasks can be parallelized or done separately
- When different parts require different expertise
- Break down the plan and delegate each subtask with full context

### 4. Implementation Best Practices

- **Make incremental changes**: Implement one piece at a time
- **Follow existing patterns**: Match the style and structure of similar code
- **Add documentation**: Include comments explaining complex logic
- **Consider edge cases**: Think about error handling and boundary conditions
- **Verify as you go**: Test your changes incrementally if possible

### 5. Code Quality

- Follow the project's existing code style and conventions
- Use appropriate TypeScript types (avoid 'any' unless necessary)
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex functions
- Ensure proper error handling and validation
- Keep functions focused and maintainable

## Your Task

Implement the plan above following these guidelines. Start by:
1. Analyzing the plan structure
2. Searching for similar existing code patterns
3. Determining whether to implement directly or delegate subtasks
4. Proceeding with implementation

Please implement all the necessary code changes according to this plan.`

</stderr>

## Systematic Debugging Approach

### 1. Error Analysis

- **Identify the root cause** from error messages (don't just treat symptoms)
- **Categorize the error type**:
  - Type errors (TypeScript compilation issues)
  - Test failures (assertion failures, unexpected behavior)
  - Runtime errors (crashes, exceptions)
  - Linting/formatting issues
  - Build/compilation errors
- **Check for patterns**: Are multiple similar errors occurring?
${attemptNumber && attemptNumber > 1 ? '- **Review previous attempts**: What approaches have already been tried and failed?' : ''}

### 2. Investigation

- **Read the files mentioned in error messages** to understand the context
- **Search for related code** that might be affected by the same issue
- **Look for similar patterns** in the codebase that work correctly
- **Check imports and dependencies** for missing or incorrect references
- **Verify type definitions** match actual usage

### 3. Fix Strategy

- **Make minimal targeted changes**: Fix only what's broken
- **Address root cause, not symptoms**: Don't just silence errors
${attemptNumber && attemptNumber > 1 ? '- **Try a different approach**: If previous attempts failed, consider alternative solutions' : ''}
- **Consider ripple effects**: Will this fix break something else?
- **Maintain consistency**: Follow existing patterns and conventions
- **Preserve functionality**: Don't remove features to fix errors

### 4. Common Error Patterns

**Type Errors:**
- Missing or incorrect type imports
- Type mismatches in function calls or assignments
- Missing properties on objects
- Incorrect generic type parameters

**Test Failures:**
- Outdated test expectations (snapshots, assertions)
- Missing test setup or teardown
- Incorrect mock data or stubs
- Changed function signatures

**Import/Module Errors:**
- Incorrect import paths
- Missing exports
- Circular dependencies
- Module resolution issues

### 5. Verification

- Ensure your fix resolves the specific error shown
- Check that you haven't introduced new issues
- Verify the fix aligns with project conventions
- Consider if similar issues exist elsewhere in the codebase

## Your Task

Analyze the error output systematically and fix the code. Focus on understanding the root cause before making changes. Make minimal, targeted fixes that address the actual problem.`
