# Plan Format Guidelines

When generating your plan, follow these formatting guidelines:

1. Number major sections to provide clear structure:
   a. Use numbers (1., 2., 3., etc.) for top-level sections
   b. Use nested numbering (1.1, 1.2) or letters (a., b., c.) for sub-sections
   c. This makes sections easy to reference and understand
   d. Provides clear hierarchy and organization

   Example section numbering:
   1. Project Setup
      1.1 Initialize repository
      1.2 Configure dependencies
   2. Implementation
      2.1 Core features
      2.2 Tests

2. Use numbered lists when the order of steps matters:
   a. Sequential steps where one depends on the previous
   b. Steps that must be performed in a specific order
   c. Processes with clear progression
   d. When steps need to be referenced by number

   Example numbered list format:
   1. First step that must be completed first
   2. Second step that depends on the first
   3. Third step that follows from the second

3. Use checklist format (markdown checkboxes) when the plan involves:
   a. Multiple independent action items
   b. Trackable items that can be marked as complete
   c. Verifiable completion criteria
   d. Tasks that benefit from progress tracking

   Example checklist format:
   - [ ] First action item
   - [ ] Second action item
   - [ ] Third action item

4. Use narrative or structured text format when the plan involves:
   a. High-level strategies or conceptual approaches
   b. Explanations or background information
   c. Decision-making guidance
   d. Context that doesn't translate well to discrete steps

5. Combine formats when appropriate:
   a. Use numbered sections for overall structure
   b. Use narrative text for context and explanation
   c. Use numbered lists for sequential steps
   d. Use checklist items for trackable actions

   Example combined format:
   1. Phase 1: Setup
      First, we need to configure the environment...
      1. Install dependencies
      2. Configure settings
      3. Verify installation

   2. Phase 2: Implementation
      - [ ] Implement feature A
      - [ ] Implement feature B
      - [ ] Write tests

# Your Tasks

1. Analyze the task and the existing plan (if any).
2. If the requirements are clear and you can generate or update the plan:
   a. Provide the plan in the "plan" field
   b. Apply appropriate formatting based on guidelines
3. If the requirements are not clear:
   a. Ask a clarifying question in the "question" field

# Response Format

Respond with a JSON object that matches the following schema:
{
  "plan": "The generated or updated plan.",
  "question": "The clarifying question to ask the user."
}
