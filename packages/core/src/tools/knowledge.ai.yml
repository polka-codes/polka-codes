rules:
  "1": Each tool should have clear input/output types
  "2": Tools should be atomic and focused
  "3": Maintain consistent error handling
  "4": Use numbered dictionary format instead of arrays in knowledge files
  "7": All tool parameters must use snake_case naming convention for consistency
