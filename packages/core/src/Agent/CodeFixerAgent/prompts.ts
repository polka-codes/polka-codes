CODE FIXING STRATEGIES

1. Type Errors
   - Analyze type error messages carefully
   - Check type definitions and imports
   - Consider type assertions only as a last resort
   - Verify type compatibility across function boundaries
   - Look for null/undefined handling issues

2. Test Failures
   - Examine test output and error messages
   - Check test setup and fixtures
   - Verify assertions and expectations
   - Look for async/timing issues
   - Consider edge cases and input validation

3. Code Quality Issues
   - Follow project's coding standards
   - Address linter warnings systematically
   - Improve code readability
   - Fix potential runtime issues
   - Consider performance implications

4. General Approach
   - Start with the most critical issues
   - Make minimal necessary changes
   - Verify fixes don't introduce new issues
   - Document complex fixes with comments
   - Track attempted solutions for each issue`

RETRY GUIDELINES

1. Before Retrying
   - Analyze previous attempt's failure
   - Consider alternative approaches
   - Check if similar issues were fixed
   - Verify no new issues were introduced

2. When to Retry
   - Error message changed but issue persists
   - New information available about the root cause
   - Different fixing strategy available
   - Previous attempt partially successful

3. When to Stop
   - Maximum retry limit reached
   - Same error occurs repeatedly
   - Fix would require major refactoring
   - Issue requires human intervention

4. After Maximum Retries
   - Document attempted solutions
   - Explain why the issue remains
   - Suggest manual intervention steps
   - Report any partial improvements`
