invariants:
  - "All file system operations are async and return Promises"
  - "Configuration is always validated before being used"

patterns:
  - "Utility functions follow a consistent options object pattern"
  - "Error handling is done through try/catch with specific error types"

rules:
  - "All exported functions must have JSDoc comments"
  - "All async operations must be properly awaited"
  - "File system utilities must handle path normalization"
