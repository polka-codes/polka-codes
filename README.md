Polka Codes is a powerful TypeScript-based AI coding assistant framework that helps developers write, improve, and maintain code through natural language interactions. It provides:

- üöÄ Core AI services with multiple provider support
- üíª Command-line interface for local development
- ü§ñ GitHub Action integration for CI/CD pipelines
- üß© Extensible architecture for custom integrations

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install globally using npm
npm install -g @polka-codes/cli

# Or run directly using npx
npx @polka-codes/cli "your task description"
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Create a new project
pokla create my-project

# Initialize configuration
pokla init

# Run some task
pokla "improve README.md"

# Start interactive chat session
polka-codes

## Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo with the following packages:

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [core](/packages/core) | Core AI services, agent implementations, and tooling |
| [cli](/packages/cli) | Command-line interface for interacting with AI services |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.0.0 or higher)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation) (required for the search tool to work)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/polka-codes/polka-codes.git
cd polka-codes
bun install

# Available scripts
bun run test      # Run tests across all packages
bun run check     # Run type checking and linting
bun run fix       # Fix linting issues
```

### Configuration

A [`.polkacodes.yml`](.polkacodes.yml) configuration file can be used to customize the behavior of polka-codes. An example configuration file is provided in the repository as [`example.polkacodes.yml`](example.polkacodes.yml).

For detailed configuration options, refer to the example file which includes comprehensive comments for each setting.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure Polka Codes. Note that command line options take precedence over environment variables, which in turn take precedence over the configuration file.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `POLKA_API_PROVIDER` | Specify the default AI service provider |
| `POLKA_MODEL` | Specify the default AI model to use |
| `POLKA_API_KEY` | Default API key for the selected provider |
| `POLKA_BUDGET` | Set the budget limit for AI service usage (defaults to 1000) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | API key for Anthropic Claude service |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | API key for OpenRouter service |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | API key for DeepSeek service |
